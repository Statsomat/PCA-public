This application is designed to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a computational method for reducing the complexity of high-dimensional data by projecting the data onto a lower-dimensional space. Moreover, it is an explorative method to gain insight into the dependencies of the data. By uploading your dataset and selecting your variables of interest, you will receive a PDF report of the PCA with additional explanations and visualizations.
