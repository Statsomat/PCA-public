<h3>Description</h3>
This application is designed to perform principal component analysis. Principal component analysis is a powerful method for reducing the complexity of high-dimensional data by lowering its dimensionality, for example by detecting collinear variables. By uploading your dataset and choosing your settings, you will receive a PDF report of the principal components with additional explanations and visualizations.
